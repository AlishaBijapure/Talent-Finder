# Talent-Finder
Millions of workers in the unstructured economy—such as domestic helpers, cooks, carpenters, tailors, and cleaners—struggle to find jobs due to the lack of formal resumes. Employers often rely on word-of-mouth, limiting opportunities.

This project focuses on making workers’ skills visible and searchable. Workers can record short videos demonstrating their skills, and AI analyzes these videos to generate Hire Cards that display key details such as skills, experience, availability, languages, and expected pay. Employers can search and filter workers by skill, location, and other criteria to find and hire the right talent efficiently.

Core Features:

Video-based skill demonstration

AI-generated Hire Cards with worker details

Search and filter functionality for employers

Mobile-first interface for easy access

This prototype demonstrates how AI can connect unstructured workers with job opportunities, turning informal skills into structured, hireable profiles.
